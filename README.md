I am going to attempt at making Snake
The plan is to make a 20 x 20 grid as the play area, and add length to the snake as usual

This would actually be the first time I attempt at adding collision to a moving object
I think the hardest part would be the collision and the randomization of the placed items
Afterthought: I was able to program it with the help of some online tutorials that helped me insert collision and randomly placed items, as well as the way to add to the snake
